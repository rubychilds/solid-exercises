TheLadders' SOLID Exercises - The Interface Segregation Principle
===============

Watch [the code-cast](http://www.cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-12/show) then dig into the exercise.

---

The expanded definition of the Interface Segregation Principle boils down to "don't depend on things you don't need." Look at ViewJobWorkflow in the "viewjob" package.

* What steps does this class take to avoid unneeded dependencies?
* What does it gain as a result?

In "oldjob" package you'll find a class called Job.

* What violations of the Interface Segregation Principle are there?
* What applications are there of the Principle that already exist?
* What further could be done to segregate this class?

Try refactoring the set of classes in "oldjob" with the Principle in mind.
